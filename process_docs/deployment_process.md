# Deployment to Robot Framework Guides

## Target Repository

<https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframeworkguides>

## General Deployment Process

*Since only one document has actually gone through this process, process will need to be refined.*

- Once an issue is completed and content created it can be considered for deployment.
- Create a feature branch for the content from robotframeworkguides.
- Copy the document to the branch.
- The document must be further reviewed for overall style and layout to be compatible with Docusaurus.
- Any work needed to make changes should be done.
- Create a PR and receive further feedback.
