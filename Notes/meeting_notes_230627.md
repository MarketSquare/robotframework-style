# Meeting Notes 2023-06-27

## Guide Demmenie

Decision: Keeping current structure
Decision: Use Slack more to discuss things instead of waiting till the next meeting.
with markdown we use the VSCode plugin Markdownlint (davidanson.vscode-markdownlint) for consistent formatting.
The timelines of the userguide are towards the end of the year so for now we can still reference it.

## Mateusz Nojek

- There will be a technical writer rewriting the user guide (will probably start working by the end of the year)
- Technical writing will most probably get paid for the work
- There will be: "User Guide", "Style Guide" and the guides from the docs
- There is going to be a new platform for hosting the documentation above
- We use Markdown for documenting (with VS Code flavour?)
- Do we go tool-agnostic or we refer to Robocop/robotidy in the style guide?
- Do we want to have references to User Guide in the Style Guide? They will probably get outdated in the future
- We need to:
do the clean-up with the issues and recognise the current state of the project
add descriptions to the issues
mark what is done and what is being worked on and what needs to be done
assign tasks to people who are eager to work on them
