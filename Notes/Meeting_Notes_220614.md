# Notes

We decided to start with very low level rules that can be defined in RoboCop and Tidy. So that those tools do fulfill this Style Guide.

MVP would be to revisit all RoboCop/Tidy Rules, if we do agree with them or want to update them.

Once that is done, we do work up the abstraction layers to more context rules.
